# Adaptations and Interim Report Preparation
This week, I included the original game mechanics back into the game, which mostly got lost after switching the VR Player Rig with the one from the All-In-One kit.

Since I developed everything of my locomotion and board-interaction in my own scripts, much of the original mechanics could be thrown out, the remainder, especially the collision interactions (with banners, tasks and coins) were put into their own script and added to the Rig's main body collider. With that, the *LocomotionTechnique* and *MyGrab* scripts were officially replaced and thusly removed.

Just early enough for the [Interim Report Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/116uspm2necxDmc0KeVXe5sMnOYOXsB1H6YPiTfF8LNk/edit?usp=sharing "The interim project report google docs presentation") next week, which next to problems encountered also included some future tasks to tackle.
