# Working on the Blog
These two weeks I spent only with working on the blog and uploading the videos I created previously to Youtube so that they can be embedded into the blog.

The only other thing worth mentioning was that I found myself two of my friends who I was able to talk into helping with the study once the time came. And it only cost me two ice pops.
