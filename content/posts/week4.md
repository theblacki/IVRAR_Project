# Post Processing Presentation Preparation
This week, I prepared my presentation for the Reverse Classroom tomorrow. My topic was **Post Processing**, something I've never done/used before.

Unfortunately, most of the post processing techniques are about colors, which is not quite that interesting for someone with color blindness, but there were still some means useful to me, especially the vignette effect already mentioned in the lecture, that is supposed to reduce motion sickness in VR - which should prove to be useful in a XR project.

After adding practical information to the data mentioned in the [related Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tjYz6Ab0oc "The explanation video provided"), especially how to get it working with the Meta-XR All-in-one toolkit, the [Reverse Classroom presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19FPeMLGb8q6AcGIqW4IBTtcKiSoxRnVSNEDhSoY5Csk/edit?usp=sharing "The post processing google docs presentation") was done.
