# Project Introduction
In the context of the lecture *Interaction in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality* (IARVR or IVRAR), I created a VR application tasking the user to overcome a parkour.

The idea is that the XR environment provides a completely new context of perception and interaction, with the rather obvious problem of having to design applications around these exact new systems and tools.

More specific, the task is to design methods of interaction and locomotion within a VR environment and implement them in a way that makes both testable. In the base implementation provided, this is accomplished via route to be covered, as well as object interaction tasks on its checkpoints that have to be solved, as well as coins to be collected on the way.

While the actual implementation, or design thereof, doesn't have to include any of those specifically, they provide a baseline of understanding of what is necessary to test and how to accomplish that.

Any problems, accomplishments, setbacks, progress and everything else relevant is to be documented or be put into presentations held within the timeframe of this project.
