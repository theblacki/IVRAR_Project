  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>New Metrics and Study Before the study execution could begin, I had to include all the metrics I wanted to gather into the game. Good that I already gave that some thought for my final presentation.
Metrics I included more metrics specific to my project with its many kinds of interaction techniques. Of course, the default interaction task metrics and global times were still measured.
Additionally, the frequency of use of the different techniques, including throws and callbacks, as well as the average distance to the ground were all monitored.

    <p>Working on the Blog These two weeks I spent only with working on the blog and uploading the videos I created previously to Youtube so that they can be embedded into the blog.
The only other thing worth mentioning was that I found myself two of my friends who I was able to talk into helping with the study once the time came. And it only cost me two ice pops.

    <p>APK Madness and Final Presentation Since everything’s finished up, I can basically start leaning back already, right? Just deploy my APK once to see if it’s actually running, and I’m good to go… right? Who would have known that this simple step would take me one full, additional week…
The APK doesn’t run Building the APK was as easy as one would expect, as was deploying it on the Meta Quest 2 via SideQuest. Just one little problem: When I tried starting it after deployment, it just instantly closed, not giving me any more feedback as to why that happened.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Game Mechanics Tweaking and Repair Two weeks before the final presentation, it was finally time to take another look at the original game mechanics - that being the parkour relevant scripts.
Original Game Mechanics As it turned out, even though I included the still relevant parts from the original scripts, the actual parkour did not quite work at the start of this week.
Even though this was only the result of some missing references, it made me take a closer look at an area of my game that still needed some straightening.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Minor setbacks This week I tried to work through a couple of things in my backlog. I still had to get the actual parkour working again, but I decided to tackle other things first, so as to not break the mechanics again.
Remote Grabbing I wanted the teleport back of the board to not just be a teleport, but instead to lay it in the left hand, the same as if grabbed, maybe even that. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to set a grabbed object of the interaction rig. That is another one of those “obvious” features I’d just expect, like the isGrabbing bool from week 11.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Mounting the TRB and Remote Control This week I implemented two new locomotion and interaction features, one being planned since the interim report, the other being another idea from the discussions thereafter.
Flying and Riding on the TeleRollingBoard One more idea from the report discussions outside the follow-after feature was to be able to fly on top of the thrown board. While I agreed at that time that it would be a nice feature, I did not expect to actually get to trying to implement it. Well, here we are.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In-world Settings Control This week, I recognized that not being able to tweak stuff in Unity while wearing the VR headset is rather inconvenient. More than that, some of the regulators could be nice to be chosen by the players themselves. So, that became my goal for this week.
Settings Sliders on the Board I put Sliders, consisting of a rectangle (to visualize the mechanic range of the slider) and a ball on top of the TeleRollingBoard and furnished it with a TMP label. Each slider got a grabbable interaction, like the board itself has one, as well as a script that just computed and provided the current value:

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The Follow-after Feature and actual Visuals The report presentation - or rather the discussion thereafter gave me some new ideas to work on, some of which I started on this week.
Hand Poses As mentioned in the presentation slides, I was inspired by the reverse classroom topic of another student and wanted to get hand poses for my TeleRollingBoard, meaning positions and orientations of the hands grabbing onto it.
As it turns out, those don’t quite work when you use the controllers (visuals) - obviously - but I only thought of that after getting the creation of hand poses working - which differs heavily from how it was shown in the reverse classroom to the way it works now and with the Meta XR All-In-One Kit.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Adaptations and Interim Report Preparation This week, I included the original game mechanics back into the game, which mostly got lost after switching the VR Player Rig with the one from the All-In-One kit.
Since I developed everything of my locomotion and board-interaction in my own scripts, much of the original mechanics could be thrown out, the remainder, especially the collision interactions (with banners, tasks and coins) were put into their own script and added to the Rig’s main body collider. With that, the LocomotionTechnique and MyGrab scripts were officially replaced and thusly removed.
